- Purpose: Repository for my algorithm and data structure code examples.
- Data Structure: a named location that can be used to store and organize data.
- Algorithm: a collection of steps to solve a problem.
- Big O Notation: describes the performance of an algorithm in terms of its input size, focusing on the worst-case scenario as the input size approaches infinity.
